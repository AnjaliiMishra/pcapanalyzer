# pcapanalyzer
a packet capture file analyzer project.
Author- Anjali Mishra 

So basically this is a project which analyses the packet capture files and states whether there are any malicious content within it. 
In addition to that it segregates the packets on the basis of protocols and displays the result in the form of graphs.
It also reads all the packtes and puts the suspicious packets onto virustotal to check for malicious packets.
